# Final_Project_ML_Programming
# EDA NLP Experimentation

This project implements and evaluates the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques, particularly Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), in improving the performance of text classification models on a sentiment analysis task. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to classify sentences into positive or negative sentiment.
